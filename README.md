# TextBlob-Spelling-Correction

#### TextBlob is a Python library for processing textual data. It provides a consistent API for diving into common natural language processing (NLP) tasks such as part-of-speech tagging, noun phrase extraction, sentiment analysis, and more.

#### Sometimes tweets, reviews, or any blog data may contain typo errors, hence first we need to correct that data to reducing multiple copies of the same words, which represents the same meaning.
